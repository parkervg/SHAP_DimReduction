# tensorflow-fcwta

TensorFlow implementation of a **fully-connected winner-take-all (FC-WTA) autoencoder**,
as described in ["Winner-Take-All Autoencoders"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.2752.pdf) (2015) by Alireza Makhzani and Brendan Frey
at the University of Toronto.

See `train_digits.py` and `train_mnist.py` for example code.

## Example images

The following images are created by `train_mnist.py`, which trains a FC-WTA autoencoder on the [MNIST digits dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) with 5% sparsity and 2000 hidden units.

This plot compares the original images (top row) to the autoencoder's reconstructions (bottom row):

This one shows the autoencoder's learned code dictionary:

Finally, here are t-SNE plots of the original data (left) and the featurized data (right):
![t-SNE visualizations of original and featurized images](images/mnist_tsne_merged.png?raw=true)

A linear SVM trained on the featurized data achieves a ~98.6% classification accuracy, which is close to the 98.8% accuracy reported in the original paper by Makhzani and Frey.
